Documentation of format of .zip files
--------------------------------------

This is a documentation for .zip files format. Both in .txt and .pdf
formats.

.pdf versions was created by me for easy printing. Not sure it needs
license.

Text authorship should belong to InfoZip.

  appnote.txt - overall structure
  extrafld.txt - description of extra fields

In case you have more recent versions, let me know via "issues".
